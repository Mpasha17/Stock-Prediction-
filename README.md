# 📈 Stock Market Predictor  

A deep learning-based stock market prediction web application built with **Streamlit**, **Keras**, and **Yahoo Finance API**. This project enables users to analyze stock trends and predict future stock prices using historical data and technical indicators.

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 **Stock Data Retrieval**: Fetch real-time stock data using Yahoo Finance API.  
- 🔍 **Moving Averages Analysis**: Visualizes 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages.  
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Model**: LSTM-based neural network trained to predict stock prices.  
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Interactive Matplotlib charts for stock trend analysis.  
- 🎯 **User Input**: Users can enter a stock symbol to retrieve and analyze stock prices dynamically.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Backend**: Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning**: Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn  
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API
